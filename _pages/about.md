Hi! I am Hari, a MS Data Science graduate student at the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I am currently working as a Research Assistant (Data Analyst) with the [Institute of Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home), India. After my bachelors, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Josh Technology Group](https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/) where I developed predictive models for [CalyxPod](https://www.pod.ai/) to reduce recruitment costs by 50%. I designed warehouse schemas, developed ETL pipelines for 3 clients and optimized over 60+ SQL scripts and OLAP techniques to reduce the latency for reports by 80%. Post that, I worked as a Software Development Engineer 1 at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/) working on [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/) where I designed and developed the core returns lifecycle for the D2C orders. I even collaborated with multiple teams to design and develop the BwP LFBF (Label-Free Box-Free) returns architecure.

My interests lie around the fields of Big Data, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
