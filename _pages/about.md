**Welcome to My World of Data and Discovery!**  

**üöÄ Meet Hari - Your Data Science Maverick!**

Hello there! I'm Hari, currently navigating the fascinating realm of Data Science as a Master's student at the prestigious [College of Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota](). But that's just the tip of the iceberg!

**üè• In the Heart of Health Informatics**

In my current role as a Research Assistant at the [Institute of Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/), University of Minnesota, I'm deeply involved in the "Advancing Health Equity" project. This initiative is more than a job; it's a mission to harness the power of data to bridge health disparities and promote equitable healthcare access for all. Under the expert guidance of [Dr. Erich Kummerfeld](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/staff/erich-kummerfeld), I'm contributing to research that has the potential to transform health equity among community school students.

**üéì A Solid Foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics**

My journey began at [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home), India, where I delved deep into Computer Science and Engineering, complemented by a minor in Mathematics. This blend of disciplines wasn't just an academic pursuit; it was a launchpad for my passion in data science.

**üíº From Predictive Models to Amazon's Tech Innovations**

Post-graduation, I joined [Josh Technology Group](https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/) as a Data Scientist. Picture this: I developed predictive models for [CalyxPod](https://www.pod.ai/), slashing recruitment costs by a whopping 50%! My days involved designing warehouse schemas, crafting ETL pipelines, and fine-tuning SQL scripts and OLAP techniques, ultimately reducing report latency by 80%.

Subsequently, I joined Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. There, I was instrumental in developing and implementing [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/), a service that extends the convenience, fast shipping, and trusted checkout experience of Amazon Prime to various online retailers. This role not only involved enhancing the shopping experience for Prime members on external websites but also empowering merchants with Amazon's fulfillment network, thereby driving customer satisfaction and business growth.

<!-- As a Software Development Engineer, I was at the forefront of [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/), Amazon's one-click solution , architecting the core returns lifecycle for D2C orders. My role was a blend of innovation and collaboration, contributing to the groundbreaking BwP LFBF (Label-Free Box-Free) returns architecture. -->

**üåü Big Data and Deep Learning: My Passion**

But what really makes my heart race? The exhilarating fields of Big Data and Deep Learning, especially their applications in autonomous vehicles. It's not just about the data; it's about how we can use it to propel us into a future where technology and humanity converge.

***Join me on this journey of exploration, innovation, and transformation. Let's redefine what's possible with data!***
