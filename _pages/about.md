Hi! I am Hari, a MS Data Science graduate student at the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home), India. After my bachelors, I worked as a Data Engineer at [Josh Technology Group](https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/) where I developed ETL scipts for warehousing and developed predictive models for [CalyxPod](https://www.pod.ai/) to reduce recruitment costs. Post that, I worked as a Software Development Engineer 1 at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/) working on a confidential project which we launched as [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/).

My interests lie around the fields of Big Data and Computer Vision.
