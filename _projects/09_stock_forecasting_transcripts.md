title: Stock Performance Forecasting using Meeting Transcripts
description: Created a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to predict stock performance using stakeholder meeting transcripts. This two-part system first condenses transcripts into concise summaries using Huggingface T5/GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and then evaluates sentiment with Huggingface BERT-based LLMs, providing a nuanced understanding of market movements influenced by stakeholder communications.
