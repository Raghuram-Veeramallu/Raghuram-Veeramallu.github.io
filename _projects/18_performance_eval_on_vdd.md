<!-- I have taken up this project to predict the motion of surrounding agents for self driving cars. This challenge has been posted by Waymo open as [Waymo Motion Prediction Challenge](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2022/motion-prediction).

I decided to take up this project as part of my course project work for CSCI 5525: Advanced Machine Learning at the University of Minnesota under [Prof. Nicholas Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/njohnsoncs). -->
