title: Knowledge Graph Augmented Common-sense Reasoning
description: Created a deep learning model enhanced by a Knowledge Graph, specifically designed to answer multiple-choice commonsense questions. This model employs a novel architecture combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Hierarchical Pooling Attention (HPA). It achieved a notable accuracy of 40%, demonstrating significant potential in comparison to human evaluation benchmarks in the realm of AI-driven commonsense reasoning.
